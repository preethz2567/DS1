### AIM 
To demonstrate proficiency in using NumPy and Pandas libraries for data manipulation and analysis. 
This includes tasks such as handling missing values, performing basic mathematical and aggregation operations, and working with various data structures such as arrays, Series, and DataFrames.

### Importing Required Libraries:
The exercise begins by importing the necessary libraries: NumPy for array manipulations and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

### NumPy Operations:

Handle missing values using NumPy's np.nan and perform operations like summing, computing mean value etc.

### Pandas Operations:

Create Pandas DataFrames and Series.

Utilize indexing and filtering using .loc[], .iloc[], and .at[].

Handle missing data with methods like dropna(), fillna(), and isnull().

Group and aggregate data using .groupby().

Perform data analysis, including calculating mean, sum, and standard deviation.

### Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess data by handling missing values and applying transformations.

### Testing and Validation:

Execute all code within the Jupyter notebook to ensure the correctness of each operation and validate the results.

Export and Documentation:

The notebook is exported as a PDF, which serves as both documentation and submission material.

### Result :
Gained hands-on experience with NumPy and Pandas.

Learned how to handle missing data (null values) and apply data cleaning techniques.

Developed skills in performing essential data operations like summarization, aggregation, and transformation.

Understood how to manipulate and analyze data using the power of Pandas and NumPy.

### Repository Structure
This repository contains the following key files:

#### DSSkill1.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook that contains all the exercises and solutions for data manipulation tasks using NumPy and Pandas.

#### DS_SKILL1.pdf — A PDF export of the notebook for offline reference and submission.
